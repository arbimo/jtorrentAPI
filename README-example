QUICK EXAMPLE TO TEST JBITTORRENT API.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example to test the JBitTorrent API.

You may run this test using 4 computers connected through Internet,
or you may run this test using only one computer.

This is the set-up that we will use in this example.

Computer   Task
Tracker    The tracker used to publish the bit torrent files 
Client1    A client that is sharing a file
Client2    A client that wishes to download that file
Client3    A client that wishes to download that file also, simultaneously


In the example, we will assume that you run the four programs in the same computer.
If that is not the case, you only need to substitute "localhost" by the IP of the computer running the tracker.

#### THE TRACKER
1. Download jbittorrentapi-v1.0.zip
2. Unzip it
3. Go to the console
4. Set the CLASSPARTH
   . ./env.sh (or execute env.bat if using MS Windows)
5. Start the tracker
   java trackerBT.Tracker example_tracker_config.xml     # It reads example_tracker_config.xml, change it according to your needs. By default, tracker listens on port 8081


#### CLIENT1
1. Download jbittorrentapi-v1.0.zip
2. Unzip it
3. Go to the console
4. Set the CLASSPARTH
   . ./env.sh (or execute env.bat if using MS Windows)

5. We will share the file example/client1/funvideo05.wmv (only 3.8Mb long)
   Otherwise, copy the file that you want to share into example/client1/funvideo.wmv
   (for instance, take a file 100Mb or 1Gb long)

6. Create a torrent file (description of the file(s) you want to share)
   java jBittorrentAPI.ExampleCreateTorrent example/client1/funvideo.torrent http://localhost:8081/announce 256 example/client1/funvideo05.wmv .. "John Lynch" .. "this is a fun video"
   
   result:
   Hashing the files...
   Hash complete... Saving...
   Torrent created successfully!!!

7. Publish the torrent file to the tracker
   java jBittorrentAPI.ExamplePublish example/client1/funvideo.torrent http://localhost:8081/upload none none "this is a fun video"
   
8. Start sharing the file (funvideo05.wmv)
   java jBittorrentAPI.ExampleShareFiles example/client1/funvideo.torrent example/client1/

   result:
   Contact Tracker. URL source = http://localhost:8081/tracker?info_hash=%D7%B47%BC%E8p%D9%08%7B%CB%E7%C4%E0%F9%9B%40%98%9BSF&peer_id=-BE0001-%DDv%40%A1%93%BAy%98%93%DFGg&port=6881&downloaded=0&uploaded=0&left=4011946numwant=100&compact=1&event=started
   Sharing... Press Ctrl+C to stop client

9. Imagine you send the torrent file (example/client1/funvideo.torrent) to two friends by email, which will execute client2 and client3.


#### CLIENT2
1. Download jbittorrentapi-v1.0.zip
2. Unzip it
3. Go to the console
4. Set the CLASSPARTH
   . ./env.sh (or execute env.bat if using MS Windows)

5. Put the torrent file that you received by email (funvideo.torrent) to example/client2/funvideo.torrent

6. Download the file (funvideo05.wmw) using the bit torrent network
   java jBittorrentAPI.ExampleDownloadFiles example/client2/funvideo.torrent example/client2/

   result: after some time, you have downloaded example/client1/funvideo05.wmv



#### CLIENT3. Execute this at the same time as client 2.
1. Download jbittorrentapi-v1.0.zip
2. Unzip it
3. Go to the console
4. Set the CLASSPARTH
   . ./env.sh (or execute env.bat if using MS Windows)

5. Put the torrent file that you received by email (funvideo.torrent) to example/client2/funvideo.torrent

6. Download the file (funvideo05.wmw) using the bit torrent network
   java jBittorrentAPI.ExampleDownloadFiles example/client2/funvideo.torrent example/client3/

   result: after some time, you have downloaded example/client1/funvideo05.wmv
